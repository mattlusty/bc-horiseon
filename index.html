        <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
        <p>
          The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone
          with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online
          Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they
          search for your business.

          marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to
